# Week-1-Challenge
## User Story
As a boot camp student
I want to refactor the starter code index.html to comform to semantic html elements as well as reorganizing the style.css
So that the site's code is easier to read and interpret for developers.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title.
